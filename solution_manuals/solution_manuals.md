title: Solution Manuals

I recently decided to write a library of solution manuals. My first, selfish, motivation for doing this is simply to practice, but I hope the solutions will be useful to others.

Along with the solutions for each section/chapter, I include a brief write up summarizing the ideas and paraphrasing proofs of important theorems.

While I try to double check my proofs as I write them up in Latex, this is a high volume game, so I am certain I will make mistakes. If you suspect an error, I would appreciate you letting me know by emailing me via <a href="mailto:davidbuch42@gmail.com">davidbuch42</a> at gmail dot com.
