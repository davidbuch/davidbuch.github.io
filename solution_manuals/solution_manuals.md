I recently decided to write a library of solution manuals. My primary reason for doing this is to motivate myself to practice math, but I hope that the solutions are useful to others who are independently studying these materials.

Along with the solutions for each section/chapter I try to include a brief write up summarizing the key ideas and paraphrasing proofs of important theorems.

While I try to double check my proofs as I write them up in Latex, this is obviously a high volume game so I am certain I will miss certaint things and make mistakes. If you suspect an error, I would appreciate you letting me know by emailing me via <a href="mailto:davidbuch42@gmail.com">davidbuch42</a> at gmail dot com.
